# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

five bullet points- 

1. I have a home page in this project where I show some job posts in the form of category tabs.
2. I have created a route in the navbar called AddJob. With which a user can post jobs.
3. I have created it in the root navbar called My Posted Jobs so that a user can see his own posted jobs.
4. I have created another route called My Bids where a user can view the bid posts that he has bid on from the job of his choice from the home page.
